E-WISE
We are from TimSitu and want to deploy an application to reduce electronic waste (E-Waste)

In response to the escalating global issue of electronic waste (e-waste) accumulation and the lack of efficient disposal methods, our team, namely "TimSitu" presents the E-Wise management mobile application as a pioneering solution. This innovative approach addresses the dual challenges of inadequate user awareness about responsible e-waste disposal and the absence of a streamlined system for collection and recycling. E-Wise aligns its mission with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, specifically targeting Target 12.5. The aim is to substantially reduce waste generation by 2030 through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.

2. Find the nearest e-waste Bank to drop the e-waste : By finding the nearest e-waste bank provides with Google Map API, users can directly dispose of their e-waste at that location.
